Regex, short for regular expressions, is a powerful tool for pattern matching and text manipulation. It provides a concise and flexible syntax for describing patterns within strings. Here are some key concepts and elements commonly used in regex:

1. **Literals:** Characters in a regex pattern that match themselves. For example, the regex `abc` matches the exact sequence "abc" in a string.

2. **Metacharacters:** Special characters with a meaning beyond their literal character. Some common metacharacters include:

   - `.` (dot): Matches any single character except a newline.
   - `^`: Anchors the regex at the beginning of a line.
   - `$`: Anchors the regex at the end of a line.
   - `*`: Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character or group.
   - `+`: Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character or group.
   - `?`: Matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding character or group.
   - `|`: Acts like a logical OR, allowing you to match either the pattern on the left or the one on the right.

3. **Character Classes:** Square brackets `[]` define a character class, which matches any single character within the brackets. For example, `[aeiou]` matches any vowel.

4. **Quantifiers:** These specify the number of occurrences of a character or group. For example, `\d{2,4}` matches two to four digits.

5. **Escape Characters:** Backslash `\` is used to escape a metacharacter, allowing it to be treated as a literal character. For example, `\.` matches a literal dot.

6. **Groups and Capturing:** Parentheses `()` are used to group characters together. They also create a capturing group, allowing you to extract matched substrings.

7. **Predefined Character Classes:**
   - `\d`: Matches any digit (0-9).
   - `\w`: Matches any word character (alphanumeric + underscore).
   - `\s`: Matches any whitespace character (space, tab, newline).
