### Explanations

Makefile step by step:

```makefile
CC = gcc
CPPFLAGS = -MMD
CFLAGS = -Wall -Werror -Wextra
LDFLAGS = -g -fsanitize=address
LDLIBS =
```

Here, we define the compiler (`CC`) as `gcc` and set some compiler and linker flags. 

- `CPPFLAGS` includes options for the preprocessor, specifically `-MMD` which generates dependency information during compilation.

- `CFLAGS` includes compiler flags, such as `-Wall` (enable most warning messages), `-Werror` (treat warnings as errors), and `-Wextra` (enable some extra warning messages).

- `LDFLAGS` includes linker flags, such as `-g` (generate debugging information) and `-fsanitize=address` (enable address sanitizer for runtime memory checking).

- `LDLIBS` can be used to specify libraries to link against, but it's empty in this case.

```makefile
SRC = main.c print_page.c
OBJ = $(SRC:.c=.o)
DEP = ${SRC:.c=.d}
HDR = print_page.h
```

Here, we define source files (`SRC`), object files (`OBJ`), dependency files (`DEP`), and header files (`HDR`). 

- `OBJ` is created by replacing the `.c` extension with `.o` for each source file.

- `DEP` is created by replacing the `.c` extension with `.d` for each source file. These are dependency files generated by the compiler, which contain information about the dependencies between source files.

- `HDR` is the header file.

```makefile
# Output binary
OUT = print_page
```

This sets the name of the output binary to `print_page`.

```makefile
# Rule for generating the binary
all: $(OUT)
```

The `all` target is the default target that gets built when you run `make` without specifying a target. It depends on the `$(OUT)` target, so it will build the `print_page` binary.

```makefile
# Rule for linking the object files
$(OUT): $(OBJ)
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $^
```

This rule describes how to link the object files (`$(OBJ)`) into the final binary (`$(OUT)`). It uses the `$(CC)` (compiler) with `$(CFLAGS)` (compiler flags) to create the executable. `$@` is a special variable that represents the target name (`print_page` in this case), and `$^` represents all the prerequisites (object files).

```makefile
# Rule for compiling source files to object files
%.o: %.c $(HDR)
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c -o $@ $<
```

This rule describes how to compile individual source files (`%.c`) into object files (`%.o`). It depends on the corresponding header file (`$(HDR)`). The `-c` flag tells the compiler to generate object files, and `-o $@` specifies the output file name.

```makefile
-include ${DEP}
```

This line includes the dependency files (`${DEP}`). Dependency files are generated by the compiler and contain information about the dependencies between source files. They are used to automatically rebuild files when their dependencies change.

```makefile
.PHONY: clean

# Clean rule to remove generated files
clean:
	${RM} ${OBJ}
	${RM} ${DEP}
	${RM} ${OUT}
```

The `.PHONY` target declares the `clean` target as a phony target, meaning it doesn't represent a file. The `clean` target removes the object files (`${OBJ}`), dependency files (`${DEP}`), and the `print_page` binary using the `${RM}` command.
