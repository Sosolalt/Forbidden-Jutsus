### Average speed :

---

S = speed in $m.s ^{-1}$ ;

d = distance in $m$ ;

t = time in $s$ ;

$$ S = \frac d t $$

### Acceleration Formula :

---

$$ a = \frac {v-u} t $$

$a$ = acceleration in $m.s^{-2}$ ;

$v$ = final velocity in $m.s ^{-1}$ ;

$u$ = initial velocity in $m.s ^{-1}$ ;

$t$ = time in $s$

### Kinetic energy :

---

$E$ = kinetic energy in $kg.m^2.s^{-2}$

$m$ = mass in $kg$

$v$ = velocity in $m.s^{-1}$

$$ E = \frac m 2 * v^2 $$

### Gravitational force :

---

$$ F_g = m * g $$

$Fg$ = gravitational force in $N$

$m$ = mass $kg$

$g$ = gravitational acceleration in $m.s^{-2}$

### Attractive force between two bodies :

---

$Fg$ = Attractive force between two bodies in $N$

$m_1$ = mass of the first body in $kg$

$m_2$ = mass of the second body in $kg$

$G$ = Universal gravitation constant

$r$ = distance between the two bodies in $m$

$$ F_{g} = \frac{G \cdot m_{1} \cdot m_{2}}{r^{2}} $$

### Newton’s Second Law:

---

$$ F = m * a $$

$F$ = force in $N (kg.m.s^{-2})$

$m$ = mass in $kg$

$a$ = acceleration in $m.s^{-2}$

### Weight Formula :

---

_Weight is not anything but the force which an object experiences due to gravity._

$W$ = weight in $N$

$m$ = mass in $kg$

$g$ = acceleration due to gravitation in $m.s^{-2}$

$$ W = m * g $$

### Pressure Formula :

---

$$ P = \frac F A $$

$P$ = pressure in Pascal _(Pa)_ $N.m^{-2}$

$F$ = force applied in $N$

$A$ = total area in $m^2$

### Ohms Law :

---

_The current running through some conductor material is directly proportional to the [potential difference](https://www.toppr.com/guides/physics/electricity/electric-potential-and-potential-difference/) between two endpoints of the conductor._

$U$ = Voltage in $V$

$R$ = Resistance in $\Omega$

$i$ = intensity in $A$

$$ U = R.i $$
