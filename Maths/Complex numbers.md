The complex number math chapter delves into the realm of numbers that extend beyond the real number line. Here are the key concepts covered:

### Introduction to Complex Numbers

#WIP

### Operations with Complex Numbers
   - Addition and subtraction of complex numbers involve adding or subtracting the real and imaginary parts separately.
   - Multiplication is performed using the distributive property, and \(i^2\) is replaced with \(-1\).
   - Division is accomplished by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator.

### The Complex Plane
   - Complex numbers can be represented graphically on the complex plane, with the horizontal axis representing the real part and the vertical axis representing the imaginary part.
   - Polar form represents complex numbers in terms of magnitude and angle.

### Polar Form and De Moivre's Theorem
   - Polar form expresses a complex number as \(r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)\), where \(r\) is the magnitude and \(\theta\) is the argument.
   - De Moivre's Theorem simplifies the expression of complex number powers in polar form.

### Roots of Complex Numbers
   - Finding roots involves expressing complex numbers in polar form and using the nth root formula.

### Complex Conjugates
   - The conjugate of a complex number \(a + bi\) is \(a - bi\).
   - Multiplying a complex number by its conjugate yields a real number.

### Applications in Engineering and Physics
   - Complex numbers find applications in various fields, such as electrical engineering (AC circuit analysis) and physics (quantum mechanics).

### Complex Exponentials and Euler's Formula
   - Euler's formula (\(e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta\)) connects complex exponentials with trigonometry.

### Complex Functions and Mapping
   - Complex functions involve mapping complex numbers to other complex numbers, often visualized using color mapping.
