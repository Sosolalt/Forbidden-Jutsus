### Lemma

A lemma is a proven proposition or a subsidiary theorem that is used in the proof of a larger theorem. Lemmas are intermediate steps in a mathematical argument, helping to establish the main result.

In other words, when mathematicians are proving a theorem, they often break down the proof into smaller, more manageable steps. These smaller steps are called lemmas, and they serve as building blocks for the overall proof. Once a lemma is proven, it can be used to prove the main theorem.

### Theorem

A theorem is a statement that has been proven to be true based on a set of axioms and previously proven statements.

### Conjecture 

A conjecture is a statement that is believed to be true based on some evidence or intuition, but it has not been proven or established as a theorem. Conjectures often arise from observations, patterns, or experimental results, and mathematicians propose them as potential truths that might be worth exploring and proving.
