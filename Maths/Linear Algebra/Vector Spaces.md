### Linear independence

A family (or set) of vectors is said to be linearly independent if no vector in the family can be written as a linear combination of the others. 

Let $E$ be a vector space and consider a family of vectors $\{\mathbf{e}_1, \mathbf{e}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{e}_n\}$ in $E$. This family is linearly independent if and only if:

$$ \begin{aligned}
& \forall (\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n, \\
& \lambda_1 \mathbf{e}_1 + \lambda_2 \mathbf{e}_2 + \ldots + \lambda_n \mathbf{e}_n = \mathbf{0} \\ 
& \qquad \implies \lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = \ldots = \lambda_n = 0
\end{aligned}$$

Otherwise, they are linearly dependent.

### Spanning family

A spanning family refers to a family (or set) of vectors that collectively span a vector space, meaning that any vector in the space can be expressed as a linear combination of vectors from this family. 

More formally, let $E$ be a vector space, and consider a family of vectors $\{\mathbf{e}_1, \mathbf{e}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{e}_n\}$ in $E$. This family is said to be a spanning family for $E$ if, for every vector $\mathbf{e}$ in $E$, there exist scalars $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_n$ such that:

$$
\lambda_1 \mathbf{e}_1 + \lambda_2 \mathbf{e}_2 + \ldots + \lambda_n \mathbf{e}_n = \mathbf{e}$$

In other words, any vector in $E$ can be represented as a linear combination of the vectors in the spanning family. The set of all possible linear combinations of vectors from the spanning family forms the entire vector space $E$. Then :

$$ 
\text{span}(\{\mathbf{e}_1, \mathbf{e}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{e}_n\}) = E $$

>[!tip]- Tips for verifying if a family is spanning
> 1) If the dimension of the space is $n$ over some field $F$.
>	Then, the set contains at least $n$ linearly independent vectors from $F^n$ must be a spanning set of that space.
> <br>
> 2) Solve the system. If you find a value for every $\lambda$ then it is spanning
